## Data preparation

N.B: Copy of the original data from Yolan are in Chapter_2_Dryness... -> documents --> Donnees_Yolan --> Donnee_Yolan_05-2023--> 'Data_Fat_analyses_Yolan'

Original dataset was modified and saved under 'Data_Fat_analyses_raw' in 'Chapter2.Dryness. ... '--> data --> 'Data_Fat_analyses_raw'

Modifications (manual because color coded) on xlxs file -->  column addition: 'collection_interval': values : blue (i.e. Yolan color code) --> early : sample collected within 6 days, yellow -->  intermediate : sample collected between 6 and 8 days (included ?), red --> late : sample collected after 8 days (should be exclude from analyses)

Save as a csv file for R processing 

__Read data__

use function 'read_fat_data_raw()' to read csv file with raw fat data from Yolan

__Clean dataset__

Aim at cleaning, organising and only keep necessary info from fat raw data using the function 'clean_raw_fat_data'

The function : 
- removes all 'mass_Jxx' columns, 
- removes columns: "samples_marrow_fat_rate", "samples_marrow_fat_rate_without_residuals", "bone_marrow_fat_rate_mean", "bone_marrow_fat_rate_mean_without_residuals","estimated_bc","estimated_bc_without_residuals",  "comments" and any columns after,
- removes empty raws after 258th line
- removes raws corresponding to Buffalo_01 --> a test sample that wasn't harvested following the study desidn (but opportunistically) and  must, thus, be excluded because it wasn't

__Save cleaned dataset__
